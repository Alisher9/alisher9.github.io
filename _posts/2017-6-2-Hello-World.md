Hello, this is my new blog page, built with Jekyll and proudly hosted at [Github pages](https://github.io).

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
